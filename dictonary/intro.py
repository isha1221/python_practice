# dictionary is a mutable and unordered
# Indexes for dictionaries are called keys, and a key with its associated value is called a key-value pair.

##NOTE: Dictionaries can still use integer values as keys,
# just like lists use integers for indexes, 
# but they do not have to start at 0 and can be any number.
