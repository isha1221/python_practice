# Zoo Simulation â€“ OOP Problem Statement
# ðŸŽ¯ Objective:
# Design and implement a zoo simulation system using Object-Oriented Programming in Python.
# The system should model different types of animals, their behaviors, and their enclosures, 
# allowing for realistic interaction and reporting of zoo status.

# ðŸ§© Key Requirements:
# 1. Animal Hierarchy (Inheritance)
# Create a base class Animal with common attributes and methods:
# name
# age
# species
# make_sound()
# feed()
# Then create subclasses for specific animals:
# Lion, Elephant, Monkey, Parrot, etc.
# Each subclass should override the make_sound() and feed() methods with unique implementations.

# 2. Enclosure Class (Composition)
# Create a class Enclosure which:

# Has a name (e.g., "Savannah Zone", "Bird House")

# Can contain multiple animals (list of Animal objects)

# Has methods to:

# add_animal()

# list_animals()

# feed_all_animals()

# 3. Zoo Class (Composition of Enclosures)
# Create a Zoo class to:

# Hold multiple Enclosure objects

# Have methods to:

# add_enclosure()

# zoo_status() (print names of enclosures and animals in them)

# feed_all_animals() (call feed on all animals in all enclosures)
